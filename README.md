## Hi there 👋 I am Dhaani Bahl
My Awesome Project:
    "Works on my machine." – Probably Me
    
Honestly? I don’t know anymore. It started as a simple idea and spiraled into something that haunts my dreams.
Welcome to the codebase where chaos meets creativity! This account contains Lotssss pf projects and is fueled by late-night caffeine, questionable Stack Overflow copy-pasting, and the occasional existential crisis.
💾 What’s Inside?

    🚀 Cutting-edge code (may or may not compile)

    🧩 Modular design (or at least I tried)

    💡 Bright ideas (some stolen from my dreams)

    🐛 Bugs (bzzzzz....)

🙃 Final Thoughts
If you’ve read this far, you’re either really bored or really brave.
Either way, thanks for visiting. Star the repo. Or don’t. I’m not your supervisor.
